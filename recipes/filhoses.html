  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p><em>Filhóses</em>, sometimes referred to as <em>malassadas</em>, are fried dough sprinkled with white sugar and cinnamon. They're similar to donut holes or funnel cake. <em>Filhóses</em> are typically considered "street food", so you aren't likely to find these delicious treats in just any restaurant. Instead, you may have more luck with festivals, food trucks, and even some cafés. <em>Filhóses</em> are typically made around Christmas, so they are seasonal, but there's nothing stopping you from creating these tasty goodies any time you're craving them. Keep reading to see how easy <em>filhóses</em> are to make!</p>
